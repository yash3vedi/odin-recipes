    <h2>Baking banana bread</h2>
    <p>
      Step 1 Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray a 9x5-inch
      loaf pan with cooking spray. In a bowl, whisk together flour, baking soda,
      baking powder, cinnamon, and salt.
    </p>
    <p>
      Step 2 In a large mixing bowl, mash the bananas with a fork until almost
      smooth, and stir in the coffee creamer, vegetable oil, eggs, sugar, and
      instant coffee granules until the coffee granules have dissolved.
      Gradually stir in the flour mixture, about 1/2 cup at a time, until batter
      is almost smooth, and pour batter into the prepared loaf pan.
    </p>
    <p>
      Step 3 Bake in preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center
      of the banana bread comes out clean, about 1 hour. Allow to cool before
      removing from pan.
